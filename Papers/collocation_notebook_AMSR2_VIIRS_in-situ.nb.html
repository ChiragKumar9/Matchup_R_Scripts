<p>	I remember when I read my first Isaac Asimov novel and dreamt one
day of robots with positron brains crawling across our Earth. Science
fiction always captivated my imagination but my 7<sup>th</sup> grade
science class crushed those dreams of robots when I realized it was
all made-up. Iâ€™ve always dreamt out of the box and yearned for
something that more. And that same year I discovered something that
was so magical and powerful, it was even better than Science Fiction:
Big Data and Machine Learning. The ability to program a computer,
which can efficiently process lots of data, to develop a human-like
intuition fascinated me and I have recognized the opportunity in
this. Computers can analyze more data than a human but could
previously not think like a human. Machine Learning enabled the
computer to gain a human-like intuition for that data, making it an
extraordinarily powerful tool in solving some of the largest problems
facing humans today. I am specifically interested in using Machine
Learning and computational techniques to solve planetary and
environmental problems. In 2014, I designed a system using Peltier
tiles to conserve energy within a home, and was awarded first place
in New York State in the Johnson Controls Igniting Creative Energy
Competition. In 2015, I built a low-cost, high-efficiency water
purifier powered by a hand crank to help people lacking access to
clean drinking water, and was selected as the New York State Merit
Winner in the 2015 Discovery 3M Young Scientist Challenge. My current
project uses Machine Learning to numerically estimate the error in
satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) measurements, which can
increase the validity of climate monitoring and predictions. Working
with Dr Guillermo Podesta of the University of Miami, I suggested a
Machine Learning  approach

<p>As part of a First Lego League team  year, in 2015, I studied
neuroscience in order to develop an app to help autistic children
learn facial expressions through the use of music and associative
learning. That project was chosen as a First Lego League Global
Innovation Semi-finalist.

<p>I have always been fascinated by all aspects of STEM and the
ability of the STEM fields to solve some of the largest problems
facing humans today. Specifically, I am interested in using
computational techniques to solve planetary and environmental
problems. Two years ago, I designed a system using Peltier tiles to
conserve energy within a home, and was awarded first place in New
York State in the Johnson Controls Igniting Creative Energy
Competition. This past year, I built a low-cost, high-efficiency
water purifier powered by a hand crank to help people lacking access
to clean drinking water, and was selected as the New York State Merit
Winner in the 2015 Discovery 3M Young Scientist Challenge. Finally,
as part of a First Lego League team last year, I studied neuroscience
in order to develop an app to help autistic children learn facial
expressions through the use of music and associative learning. That
project was chosen as a First Lego League Global Innovation
Semi-finalist. My recent interest is in computational techniques and
Machine Learning. The ability to program a computer, which can
efficiently process lots of data, to develop a human-like intuition
has always captivated me and I have recognized the opportunity in
this. These computational techniques can be applied to improve
analysis of oceanographic data and lead to more accurate climate and
weather modeling.</p>
